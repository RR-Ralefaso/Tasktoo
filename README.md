XML Data Transformer in Java

This project is a step-by-step Java application that transforms XML data using AI-guided development and commits after each significant milestone. The application progresses from simple data reading to robust, validated user-interactive JSON output, and finally transitions to a SAX parser for XML.
📁 Project Structure

Each step of development is committed separately. You can follow the evolution of the application through the commit history.
🚀 Features
✅ Step 1: Read and Print XML Fields

    Reads an uploaded XML file.

    Prints all field values to the console.

✅ Step 2: Filter by User-Selected Fields

    Prompts the user to select fields to view.

    Only prints the selected fields.

✅ Step 3: Output in JSON Format

    Transforms selected fields to JSON format.

    Outputs the result to the console.

✅ Step 4: Add Input Validation

    Handles invalid or unexpected user input gracefully.

    Prevents crashes and provides helpful error messages.

✅ Step 5: Use SAX XML Parser

    Switches from traditional DOM parsing to SAX.

    Improves performance for large XML files.
