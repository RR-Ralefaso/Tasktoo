This project is a step-by-step Java application that transforms XML data using AI-guided development and commits after each significant milestone. The application progresses from simple data reading to robust, validated user-interactive JSON output, and finally transitions to a SAX parser for XML.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each step of development is committed separately. You can follow the evolution of the application through the **commit history**.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Step 1: Read and Print XML Fields
* Reads an uploaded XML file.
* Prints all field values to the console.

### ✅ Step 2: Filter by User-Selected Fields
* Prompts the user to select fields to view.
* Only prints the selected fields.

### ✅ Step 3: Output in JSON Format
* Transforms selected fields to JSON format.
* Outputs the result to the console.

### ✅ Step 4: Add Input Validation
* Handles invalid or unexpected user input gracefully.
* Prevents crashes and provides helpful error messages.

### ✅ Step 5: Use SAX XML Parser
* Switches from traditional DOM parsing to SAX.
* Improves performance for large XML files.
